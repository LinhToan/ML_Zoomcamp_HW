My homework solutions for DataTalksClub's Machine Learning Zoomcamp. Initially I do them in a Jupyter notebook, then I split the homework up into separate Python files for each problem, and write their respective unit tests. These are the topics covered:
1. Introduction
2. Regression
3. Classification
4. Evaluation
5. Deployment
6. Trees
7. Production
8. Deep Learning
9. Serverless
10. Kubernetes
11. Kserve
